This project is an implementation of the analysis and modeling pipeline for the competitive data science project conducted as part of the **FIND IT 2025** competition, specifically titled **"Data Analytics Competition FIND IT 2025"**

Forecasting temperature rise using machine learning classification models. This project aims to develop a machine learning model that predicts whether a mobile application is at risk of violating the Children‚Äôs Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA). The model helps identify potentially non-compliant apps by analyzing various app-level features.

## Business Understanding

In today's digital ecosystem, mobile applications are increasingly accessible to children, offering content for entertainment, education, and interaction. However, this accessibility also raises serious concerns about children's online privacy‚Äîparticularly regarding how personal data is collected, stored, and shared by these apps.

To address these concerns, the Children‚Äôs Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) was enacted in the United States, requiring apps to obtain verifiable parental consent before collecting personal data from users under the age of 13. Similar laws exist in other jurisdictions. Despite these regulations, enforcement remains challenging, as many apps may unknowingly‚Äîor even deliberately‚Äîviolate compliance rules.

## Data Overview

The dataset used in this project was collected from a major mobile app marketplace and enriched with features relevant to privacy, compliance, and user behavior. It includes a combination of categorical, numerical, and boolean features that describe various aspects of each app, from basic metadata (e.g., genre, rating) to compliance-related signals (e.g., privacy policy presence, email type, etc.).
